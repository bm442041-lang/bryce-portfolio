            <h1>My Hobbies & Interests</h1>
            <p>Outside of my finance studies at UMD, I spend time pursuing activities that keep me active, engaged, and connected to the beautiful Duluth community. These hobbies provide balance to my academic life and help me develop skills that complement my career goals.</p>

                <h2>Football</h2>
                <p>Football has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. I love the strategy, teamwork, and excitement of the game. Whether I'm watching UMD Bulldogs games, following professional teams, or playing pickup games with friends, football brings people together and teaches valuable lessons about perseverance and collaboration.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Football has taught me about goal-setting, teamwork, and handling pressure—skills that translate directly to my finance career. The analytical thinking required to understand game strategies mirrors the analytical skills I use in financial analysis.</p>

                <h2>Golf</h2>
                <p>Golf is more than just a sport to me—it's a form of meditation and personal challenge. I've been playing for three years now and love the combination of technical skill and mental focus it requires. There's something peaceful about being on the course, especially at Duluth's beautiful golf courses with their stunning lake views.</p>
                <p><strong>Personal story:</strong> One of my most memorable rounds was playing at Enger Park Golf Course at 6 A.M. with my brother. Since it was so early, we had the whole course to ourselves. Watching the sun rise while playing with my brother in the crisp morning air reminded me why I love this city and this sport. Golf has taught me patience, precision, and the importance of practice—qualities that serve me well in my studies.</p>

                <h2>Outdoors & Sightseeing</h2>
                <p>Living in Duluth has given me an incredible appreciation for outdoor activities. I spend weekends hiking the North Shore trails, exploring Lake Superior's shoreline, and discovering new scenic spots. These adventures provide the perfect counterbalance to my academic studies and keep me connected to nature.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it's important:</strong> Time outdoors clears my mind and helps me think more clearly about complex financial concepts. The problem-solving skills I develop while navigating trails translate to analytical thinking in my finance coursework. Plus, the natural beauty of Duluth reminds me why I chose to stay here for college.</p>
