            <h1>Discover Duluth & UMD</h1>
            <p>Duluth and the North Shore offer amazing views, trails, and lakeside stops. Here are a few highlights I love visiting, plus my reasons for choosing the University of Minnesota Duluth.</p>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>Why I Chose UMD</h2>
            <p>I chose the University of Minnesota Duluth because I'm from Duluth and really like the culture, community, and natural beauty of this area. Growing up here, I've always appreciated the strong sense of community, the outdoor lifestyle, and the genuine friendliness of the people.</p>
            <p>UMD offers excellent academic programs, particularly in business and finance, while maintaining that close-knit community feel I love. The campus is beautiful, the professors are accessible, and there's always something happening in Duluth. Plus, being able to study finance while staying connected to my hometown and family has been incredibly valuable.</p>

        <div class="grid">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Canal Park</h3>
                <p>Walk the Lakewalk, watch ships under the Aerial Lift Bridge, and grab coffee. This is where I go to clear my head and enjoy Lake Superior's beauty.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Park Point</h3>
                <p>Long sandy beach for sunsets and relaxing by Lake Superior. My go-to spot in the summertime.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Enger Tower</h3>
                <p>Panoramic views of Duluth—especially beautiful at sunset. I love bringing friends here to show off our city.</p>

            <h2>Campus Highlights & Personal Experiences</h2>
            <p>UMD's campus offers the perfect blend of academic excellence and natural beauty. I love studying in the library with views of Lake Superior, walking between classes surrounded by trees, and the sense of community that comes from being part of a smaller university within the larger University of Minnesota system.</p>
            <p>Some of my favorite campus experiences include attending Bulldogs games, taking breaks by the campus pond, and milling around campus in general. The professors here are genuinely invested in student success, and the small class sizes allow for meaningful connections and personalized learning.</p>
